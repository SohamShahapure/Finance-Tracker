# Finance-Tracker
This is a finance Tracker which I have made as a tutorial project from Tech With Tim.

I have added some of my own features:

1) Clearing all of the data from already existing CSV file
2) Converting the csv file to excel file 
3) Sending a reminder to the user for filling the expenses using Task Scheduler
